This repository is used for Janhektor's community project.<br>
We are going to code a Minecraft PvP Plugin for Spigot.<br>

Janhektor is a German youtuber making tutorials about programming, especially for Spigot and BungeeCord on his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Janhektor).<br>
This repository is used to manage the code which is produced by Janhektor and the community.<br>
The project was started on Beginning of July 2015 has the goal to code a HungerGames-Like Spigot-PvP-Plugin and is still not finished yet! - This means that you can help us (see below).<br>


<br>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
Maybe you don't believe that something like this project works.
<b>But it's simple</b>:<br>
<ol>
<li>Every public tutorial causes new code which will be pushed to this repo</li>
<li>If someone has an idea to improve or extend this plugin, it's possible to do that and create a pull request</li>
<li>Pull requests will be reviewed be one of the collaborators</li>
<li>If everything is well, the changes will be merged with this public code-base</li>
</ol>
Larger choices aren't decided by only one - we'll create a public available poll where everybody can vote. After voting we are going to analyse the result.

<br>
